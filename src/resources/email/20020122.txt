John,

Hope you don't mind me being a little forward.

I don't know if you remember me or not. We used to have those date nights with that friend of yours?

I believed she referred to them as a funday sunday? I was wondering if you'd like to go out again.

Anyways, It would be great catching up with you. Let me know.
