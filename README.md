A Silly Personal Project

Imagine for a moment, you come across an abandoned computer,
what would the data left on the device say? Would you find
written documents? Pictures? What exactly would you find on
the device?

Perhaps you would find heartache, loneliness, depression
and sadness.

What would you do with that information? What lessons could
be learned from it?
